# Used Cars Dataset EDA
## Introduction

In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will use the 'Used Cars' dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) to gather as much information as possible about the data.

Subsequently, after completing the dataset cleaning, we will conduct a small business simulation exercise with the remaining cars. In this exercise, we will simulate owning all these cars and outline a small business strategy for a rental/leasing company.
